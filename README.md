# Simple Groovy Bootstrap Project

All that this project contains is a skeleton bootstrap project which allows someone to get up and running quickly with a simple Groovy project built by Gradle.

A few of the things configured/included are:

- TestNG
- Mockito
- Google Guava
- Apache Language Commons

The dependency versions may or may not be up to date, so you might want to verify that you have the latest and greatest if you choose to use this project.


## Future Stuff

I will likely end-up modifying this project to produce an executable "uber JAR".
